Worldline Front-End Test 
Create a simple front-end application for a Post board that allows a user to create and manage different lists of Posts. You will be consuming and using the external API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for this. 
The application should implement the following user stories:
	1.	As a user, I can view all posts with pagination.
	2.	As a user, I can view a specific post and its related comments.
	3.	As a user, I can create a post.
	4.	As a user, I can update an existing post.
	5.	As a user, I can delete a post.
	6.	As a user, I can view all users and their respective posts. 
Notice that the API doesn’t persist create, update and delete methods. Keep that in mind when completing the tasks. 
The user stories are in priority order. Please complete as many as you can, but don’t spend more than 3 hours on the task. This test will be used for further discussion during the technical interview, so it’s not graded based on completion.
Please write the application with React and Typescript. You are free to use external libraries as well, but be ready to motivate why you choose them.
We will be reviewing how you structure the new applications, which processes, practices and standards you put in place. Some of the things we may look for are: 
	•	Code quality and Organization: is the code well-structured and easy to read?
	•	State Management Approach: Is the state/props handling effective?
	•	Component Design: How are the components structured and designed?
	•	Technology Stack: which libraries where used (if any) and why?
	•	User Experience: Is the application user-friendly and intuitive?
When you are finished with everything, please push the code to a public git repository. Include a README file with directions on how to install and start the application. Then send us the link. Thank you and we do hope you will have fun doing this assignment!
